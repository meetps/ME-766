# Matrix Multiplication using MPI and OpenMP

#### Meet Pragnesh Shah | 13D070003  

### Experiments and Conclusion

I ran the experiments for square matrices of size N = [ 100, 1000 , 2000 ]. The time taken by matrices larger than N = 2000 was larger than a couple minutes and the trends in the graphs were similar and hence I have skipped them. The plots of the time taken for computing A*B for the given sizes are plotted against the number of threads varying from 1 to 8.

As we can see from the plots the reduction in time is significant when going from `n_threads` going from 1 to 2/3, but later this reduction dies out. This can be reasoned due to the fact that the latency of the message transmissions becomes comparable to the individual parallel computations and hence there is no significant reduction in the total time taken,

NOTE : This trends are a bit random. I observed a ~5% change in times when computed in the same environment under similar conditions.
